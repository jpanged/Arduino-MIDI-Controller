# Arduino-MIDI-Controller

This is an Arduino MIDI Project (AMP) based on the MINI Untztrument sketch by the Ruiz Brothers on Adafruit. Our goal for this project was to experiment and gain more knowledge/experience with the Arduino platform, both from working with hardware such as the Adafruit Trellis to learning the software and implementing features such as a state changer.
