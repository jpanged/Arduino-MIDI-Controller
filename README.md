# Arduino-MIDI-Controller

This is an Arduino MIDI Project (AMP) based on the MINI Untztrument sketch by the Ruiz Brothers on Adafruit. Our goal for this project was to experiment and gain more knowledge/experience with the Arduino platform as well as using git. We were able to work with hardware such as the Adafruit Trellis and learn how to read and write to its LEDs, as well learn the software and implement features such as a state changer.
